      <div class="heading">What is Probability Amplification ?</div>
      Suppose, you have an algorithm \(A\) for a decision problem such that it gives the correct answer with probability at least \(p > 1/2\). Although \(A\) may fail with some probability, but such algorithms are generally "simple" and "efficient". Typically, these type of algorithms use randomly generated inputs; thus are called randomized algorithms. Besides the failure probability, randomized algorithms have another caveat: requiredment of randomly generated input. Various methods have been developed to reduce the probability of error and requirement of randomness for randomized algorithms. These methods are called Probability Amplification techniques. 
      <br><br>Back to \(A\), one way to reduce failure probability is by repeating \(A\) and returning the majority vote as the final answer. Now, we wish to figure out the minimum number of repetitions, so that the probability of success for repeated-\(A\) exceeds certain threshold, \(p_n > q\). One method to find \(n\) is chernoff inequality. The following figure illustrates,

      <div class="heading">What is this Project ?</div>
      In this project, we investigate, implement, evaluate and compaure probablity amplification techniques for randomized algorithms. We organise and classify these techniques to aid both practical applications and research in this field.

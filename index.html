      Randomized algorithms typically come with two caveats: they require access to a "good" random seed, and have a probability of failure. Many techniques exist to mitigate both aspects, such as using k-wise independent hash functions (to reduce the amount of randomness required) and probability amplification techniques (to reduce the probability of failure). This project will consist of (1) an extensive literature review of techniques for probability amplification, and (2) an implementation and empirical evaluation of their performance, for a couple of key applications.

      <div class="subblock">
       Probability amplification techniques try to reduce the failure probability of randomized algorithms "while maintaining efficiency". As part of the project, a comprehensive literature survey will be conducted covering classical and modern techniques such as concentration inequalities, k-wise independence, pseudo-randomness, and expander-based methods. We aim to implement and evaluate these techniques for a couple of key applications.

      <div class="heading">Introduction</div>
      <div class="subblock">
      Randomized algorithms solve problems by making random choices during execution. However, they often yield correct results with only a certain probability. Enhancing this success probability (amplification) while maintaining efficiency is vital for practical deployment. Several tools from probability theory and discrete mathematics have emerged to achieve this—such as the use of Chernoff bounds, expander graphs, and derandomization techniques. This project seeks to understand, evaluate, and implement effective methods for probability amplification, with a long-term view of integrating these methods into a reusable software library (tentatively called Ralgos).
